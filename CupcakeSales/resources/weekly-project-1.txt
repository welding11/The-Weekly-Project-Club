•	These documents never have dates, each line was entered on a different day.  The bottom-most row is always 'Today', the row above that is 'Yesterday', and so on.
•	The files are always lined up perfectly, you never have to worry about them being 'out of sync' or anything like that.
•	Basic.txt is the number of basic cupcakes she sold on that day, and they cost $5.  
•	Deluxe.txt is the number of Deluxe cupcakes (they have sprinkles!) sold on that day, and they cost $6.  
•	Total.txt is the total money she made (let's not even think about taxes yet, ugh).

1.	Yearly Revenue Totals
2.	Monthly Revenue Totals
3.	Weekly Revenue Totals

If you want to get fancy, here's how you might take it even further: 
1.	Break these stats down by item.
2.	Generate a graph of the data, Matilda loves charts
3.	Get creative with the input.  Maybe you can think of something she'll actually use.
